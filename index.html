    <h2>The future of money</h2>

    <p>Bitcoin, in simplest terms, is a computer network. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">Computer networks</a> are made up of nodes (computers) which communicate with each other.  Your bitcoin - the amount of bitcoin you own - can be thought of as an <em>amount </em>of bitcoin in an <em>account</em>, and that account resides on the Bitcoin network.</p>

    <p>To clarify, imagine a single - but very long! - piece of paper listing all the accounts in one column and all the amounts associated with those accounts in another. A Bitcoin account (or address) looks like this:</p>

    <p class="center"><a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1GddSSupk3WfeSRGgsr35vSAieoWKB5gh4">1GddSSupk3WfeSRGgsr35vSAieoWKB5gh4</a></p>

    <p>Associated with this account will be an amount of bitcoin - maybe 1 BTC or 2 BTC but in any case never more than 21 million BTC, because 21 million is the maximum possible bitcoin supply for the entire Bitcoin network! There are no metal coins or paper bills to deal with at all! Your bitcoin is essentially a digital entry in a record keeping system for economic transactions known as a ledger. In the Bitcoin network this ledger has a special name - the block chain.</p>

    <p>A unique aspect of Bitcoin is that it is a decentralized system. Specifically, it is a distributed consensus system.  This means that no authority guarantees the validity of our list of accounts and amounts. Instead, each node on the network keeps an identical copy of the list. Any changes to the list are propagated through the network and verified by everyone participating. Anyone who has some technical know-how can set up a node and participate by keeping a copy of this list and verifying the new transactions on the network. There is no need to ask for permission, acquire a license, or pass an exam of any kind. If you would like more information about how to set up your computer as a node on the Bitcoin network you can check <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node">this</a> out.</p>

    <p>The individual accounts on the network also cannot be manipulated by anyone but their owners. This is because the only person who can access a Bitcoin account and send bitcoin from one address to another is the owner of that account's private key.  A private key looks like this:</p>

    <p class="center">5JAM2q3ZvYY9oxARna49rKbSYknQ6BbdSXPEVkFK6552aX7WaoL</p>

    <p>You can <a href="http://www.swansontec.com/bitcoin-dice.html">make your own private key</a> from a long series of random numbers. And private keys are unforgeable because&#8230;maths. <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/ECDSA">Here</a> you can find and explanation of why Bitcoin private keys are unforgeable. So Bitcoin is free from intervention, corruption, confiscation, and censorship!</p>

    <p>But Bitcoin can do much much more. With multi-signature accounts, escrow functions can be performed. Additional layers of logic for <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=106373.0">issuing equities</a> within the Bitcoin network have been explored. And merchants can integrate Bitcoin into their e-commerce sites and accept payments <a href="https://bitpay.com/">directly</a>. There are so many unique projects being developed right now utilizing the Bitcoin network! A healthy forum for up-to-date information about Bitcoin is the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/top/">Bitcoin reddit</a> community. Bitcoin is actively discussed and even given away for <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2a6sot/free_bits_to_play_around_with_to_anyone_new_to/">free</a> there sometimes! Getting involved with these passionate people is a great way to learn more about Bitcoin's myriad aspects and applications. If you are more interested in getting under the hood and understanding the technical aspects of Bitcoin (And there are many! After all, it's programable money!) you might want to check out Andreas Antonopoulos' book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449374042/?tag=masterbitcoin-20"><cite>Mastering Bitcoin</cite></a>. But a more important first step to understanding Bitcoin and how Bitcoin works is to get your hands on some bitcoin.</p>

    <p>In the early days of Bitcoin, there were websites called '<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/List_of_faucets">faucets</a>' where bitcoin was given away for free as a reward for playing little games. These days, given the enormous rise in value of a bitcoin, it is much more common for a first time bitcoin user to purchase their first bitcoin. It is not even necessary to purchase a whole bitcoin. Bitcoins are, for all intents and purposes, infinitely divisible.  It is enough to purchase a very small amount, say 0.006 BTC. The point is to get a sense of how the system functions.</p>

    <p>One of the easiest and safest ways to acquire bitcoin is through <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/?ch=3993">localbitcoins.com</a>.  It has a rating system much like eBay which allows users to choose bitcoin sellers based on their reputation.  Methods for purchasing bitcoin include meeting in person, sending a wire transfer, and Western Union.  The accepted method of payment varies from seller to seller and will be clearly indicated on the information page of the seller - usually with detailed and clear step-by-step information on how to complete the purchase.</p>

    <p>Another possibility is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinbase.com/">coinbase.com</a>. Coinbase allows you to link a bank account to your Coinbase account and purchase bitcoin directly from Coinbase. The verification process can take upwards of a week however, so if you're in a hurry this is not a good option. Another downside to Coinbase is the verification process itself. Bitcoin was intended to be able to be used anonymously. Linking identity to addresses lays the foundations for monetary surveillance, known in the Bitcoin world as 'taint analysis' - which could endanger Bitcoin's free market potential in the future.</p>

    <p>Bitcoin is also traded in online exchanges against <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">other cryptocurrencies</a> just like how euros can be traded for dollars on the FOREX. Some of these exchanges accept <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money">fiat currency</a> deposits and so they represent yet another possibility for getting your hands on some bitcoin. If you are interested in markets and finance anyhow, you might want to go this route to start familiarizing yourself with some Bitcoin exchanges while you buy your first bitcoin.  Here are a couple of popular exchanges listed with their legal jurisdictions:</p>

    <p class="center"><a href="https://bter.com/signup/229275">bter.com</a> - China<br><a href="https://www.cryptsy.com/users/register?refid=320123">cryptsy.com</a> - United States</p>

    <p>A word of caution however: Bitcoin exchanges are notoriously dangerous because, when you use an exchange, the exchange holds the private key for that bitcoin. Essentially, you are trusting the exchange to behave ethically and to have adequate security in place to protect themselves from theft. This hasn't always worked out so well in practice (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox">Mt. Gox</a>). As a general rule it is not a good idea to leave bitcoin sitting on an exchange for any length of time. So, once you buy your bitcoin, if you're not going to be trading with it, move it to a <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet">secure wallet</a>. Alternatively you can use a <a href="https://bitshares.org/?r=content">decentralized exchange</a> which is a very new form of cryptocurrency exchange created to eliminate this kind of risk.</p>

    <p>One drawback of the Bitcoin ecosystem which has recently <a>emerged as important</a>, is poor resource allocation.  New bitcoins are emitted into the network at a rate governed by the amount of total computing power on the network. And more specifically, they are emitted directly to the nodes (otherwise known as bitcoin miners) who are processing the transactions on the network and in proportion to the amount of computer power that node is contributing to the network. This is done as an award for their participation. As a result, a huge race has arisen to contribute as much computing power to the network as possible, as this can be profitable.  The race has driven the mining community to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ihMqEDs4B8">industrial levels</a> of energy consumption and elevated property rental costs to house their specialized equipment. Consequently, the miners must sell the bitcoin they earn through the mining process immediately to cover the running costs of their operations and buy more equipment in order to stay competitive.  This is a wasteful cycle and depresses what would otherwise be a very valuable bitcoin.</p>

    <h1><img src="img/bitshares.png" style="width:27px; height:27px">BitShares</h1>
    <h2>An open economic experiment</h2>

    <p>In 2013 Daniel Larimer laid the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=14019.0">foundations</a> of what was to become BitShares.  BitShares is another distributed consensus network similar to Bitcoin but with some important differences. For one, in the BitShares network design, attention has been paid to the resource allocation problem described above for Bitcoin.  Instead of emitting coins proportional to computer resources donated to the network (a distribution scheme called proof of work, or POW) coins are emitted to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?board=61.0">delegates</a> who are voted into their positions. At the time of writing (early 2015) there are 101 delegate positions available on the BitShares network. Delegates campaign to be elected; somewhat as political candidates would - using proposed projects to improve the BitShares network as campaign platforms. Once elected, the funds they receive from the network flow into the implementation of those projects. So there is light monetary inflation in the ecosystem, like in Bitcoin, but it is efficiently directed back to the benefit of the network itself. It is similar in design to a <a ref="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/technology/for-founders-to-decorators-facebook-riches.html?_r=0">company which issues stock</a> instead of cash to pay for expenses early in its life cycle.</p>

    <p>Voting occurs by spending funds. All users on the network can vote for their preferred delegates simply by making transactions. A slate of delegates - 101 of them in total - can be selected in each individual's <a href="https://bitshares.org/get-started?r=content">wallet</a> (the software interface with which you access the network). Each time a transaction is made, votes are given to the delegates proportional to the transacted amount. This system is called distributed proof of stake, or DPOS. The ability to vote on the network also renders it extremely adaptive and agile - able to integrate changes and resilient to outside attacks.</p>

<p>BitShares is an extremely complex project and has so many features that it can appear quite daunting. It takes some time to understand it and because of its adaptive nature it changes quickly as well.   It can be seen as an open financial playground - a platform where almost anything done in modern finance is available to everyone internationally with no barrier to entry. There is an integrated market where you can issue your own assets - known as a User-Issued Assets, or UIAs. There are Market-Issued Assets which are pegged to real world assets via price feeds provided by the delegates. You can short assets, you can take long positions, and you can trade against other currencies with professional trading tools as you would on an exchange. And the positions taken on market issued assets are backed by 300% collateral! Tendentially, all trading options are being included.</p>

    <p>All these transactions incur transaction fees, and those fees are paid out to bitAsset holders over time. If you hold Market-Issued Assets in the system, for example bitUSD, you earn interest on those assets (currently approximately 1.7% - better than most banks, but potentially significantly higher as the network matures).</p>

    <p>If you would like more information about how to get involved with BitShares there are a number of places to go. A comprehensive introduction to the world BitShares is probably best had by reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QUIWHR0/?tag=bitshares101-20">BitShares 101</a> by Max Wright which is aimed at readers with no prior knowledge of the system. There's a series of <a href="http://bitshares.tv/?r=content">videos</a> about the project with understandable explanations of many of its aspects as well as discussions and interviews with some of the project's developers. More advanced theoretical texts written by the lead developer and designer of the system can be found <a href="http://bytemaster.bitshares.org/?r=content">here</a>. There is also a <a href="http://wiki.bitshares.org/index.php/Main_Page">wiki</a>, a <a href="https://bitshares.org/?r=content">homepage</a>, and a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://bitsharestalk.org/">forum</a>.</p>
